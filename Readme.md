# Delete invoices module

The module can **delete all the invoices from DB** or delete invoices from a certain number, in order to regenerate the invoice number.

Sometimes during development we make fake orders and it makes generate invoices, **before deployment in to production is nice to regenerate the invoice number** deleting all the invoices in DB.

*Notice: This is a quick module that I made for personal porpuse in my workflow.*
